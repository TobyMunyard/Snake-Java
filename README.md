# Snake-Java
### What is this?
The classic game of snake made entirely in Java.

This project was a test of how timers work in Java for updating the screen as well as how taking user input based on keys worked before we discussed it in a university context.

 ### Why make this project?
This is a older project and at the time I was not very familiar with Java GUI components so I decided something fun and interactive like snake would be a good place to put my learning into a practical scenario.

### How to build the project
This project does not use any specific build tools, forking the repository and running the SnakeGame file should, to my knowledge start the game.

### Where could I improve?
* More Features: This is all stuff that was been done before meaning a lot of this is known territory and something I could look up if I was in need of help. I could have branched out a bit and added other features such as the spikes similar to the apples that would instead end the game if touched.
